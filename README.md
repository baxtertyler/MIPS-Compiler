**Two-pass SPIM emulator to run MIPS assembly code, created in Java**

Fully functional SPIM emulator in Java for executing MIPS assembly code. The emulator allows users to navigate through the program dynamically, offering options to step through lines, run specific segments, or execute the entire program. Users can inspect memory and register values at any point, terminate the program, and reset the register state. Later enhancements included the integration of a pipeline and branch predictor, including accurate addition of stalls and squashes when required.

* Developed the two-pass SPIM emulator from the ground up, utilizing Java to create a robust platform for executing MIPS assembly code.
* Enable users to interact with the emulator by stepping through lines, running specific program segments, or executing the entire code.
* Integrated functionality for users to inspect memory and register values at any point during program execution.
* Evolved the emulator by adding a pipeline and branch predictor, demonstrating a keen understanding of computer architecture and enhancing the emulator's capabilities for accurate program execution.
